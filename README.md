This project has a main server file named server2.js. This project includes routing, API endpoints, CRUD operations, schema design of person and menuItems. It is deployed on render.
Faced an issue of mongo DB connection error in render. Solved it by adding the IP addresses from the render project to the mongoDB atlas Network Access section.
